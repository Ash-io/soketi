pWS is a free, open-source alternative for the Pusher service. üì°

The server is built on top of [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js), a (ported to Node.js) C application that claims to be running _[8.5x that of Fastify](https://alexhultman.medium.com/serving-100k-requests-second-from-a-fanless-raspberry-pi-4-over-ethernet-fdd2c2e05a1e) and at least [10x that of Socket.IO](https://medium.com/swlh/100k-secure-websockets-with-raspberry-pi-4-1ba5d2127a23).

## ü§ù Supporting

Renoki Co. loves building open source (and helpful) projects on Github for any developer to have an easier job at building products. üì¶ Developing and maintaining projects is a harsh job and tho, we love it.

If you are using your application in your day-to-day job, on presentation demos, hobby projects, or even school projects, spread some kind words about our work or sponsor our work.

_Kind words will touch our chakras and vibe, while the sponsorships will keep the open-source projects alive._
