# Implementing App Managers

Apps are used to allow access to clients, as well as to be able to securely publish events to your users by using signatures generated by app secret. In this document you will have a small insight about how you can configure your own apps, as well as leveraging the official ecosystem apps to get started easily.

## Array Driver

The default driver is called `array`. This is a static array in-memory that is kept while the uWS Server process is running. Whenever a connection is made or an event is broadcasted, the app credentials will be checked using this method.

You might use the `DEFAULT_APP_*` variables to set the default app details.
